## My process
I started with adding the background and the gradient color. Once I was done with that, I proceeded to build the card container that contains the main content. The next step I took after that was adding the image. I proceeded to add the title and the paragraph and also added the rest of the contents afterward.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

It took me a while before I was able to figure out how to add a gradient color to a background image. I had to seek from some help from starkoverflow and W3school and the end, I finally figured it out.

```css

body {
  background-color: hsl(225, 100%, 94%);
}

.btn {
  background-image: url(images/pattern-background-desktop.svg);
  height: 435px;
}

.ztn {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  height: 100vh;
}

.box {
  background-color: white;
  border-radius: 20px;
  height: 550px;
  width: 340px;
  box-shadow: 10px 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.35);
}

```


### Continued development

Having completed this project, one of the areas that I would love to work on is CSS Grid. I have not been able to master it properly and I still need to build more project with it.

Also, I'd like to focus more on how to create "CARDS" in CSS

### Useful resources
